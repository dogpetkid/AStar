# A*

This is a simple javascript pathfinding project that implents the A* pathfinding algorithm.

To test this project:

* Clone or download a zip of the repository
* Open the index.html
* Open the console (in Chrome `CTRL+SHIFT+i` and go to console)
* In the console run `AStar()` and then `draw(canvas)`

To edit the layout, open `Astar.js` and edit the `goal`, `start` and `obstacles` variables.
